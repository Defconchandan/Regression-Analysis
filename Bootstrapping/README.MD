## Estimating Standard Error of Mean
Standard Error of Mean (SEM) is an inferencial statsitics quantifying the variability of the means in the sampling means. For estimating SEM we need the sampling distribution of means. Then using the standard deviation of sample mans and the sample size one can obtain the SEM as follows:

For **Normally Distributed Sample** we can use the following formula:

For other, **Non-symmetric and Skewed Distributed Samples** we can't use the above forumla. We can estimate the SE of median by using **Bootsrapping** (if we have a sample) or **Monte Carlo Simulations**(if we have some idea hoow the distributionn looks like and can use similar distributioon to repreatadly sample from).
